# 🌌 Gemini Clone

Welcome to **Gemini Clone**, a web application inspired by the simplicity and functionality of Gemini! This project marks my **first encounter** with building a full-stack web application with AI, and it has been an exciting learning experience. Whether you're here to explore the code, run the app locally, or just curious about my journey, I'm glad you're here!

## 🚀 About the Project

Gemini Clone is a web app that mimics the core features of Gemini, focusing on clean design and user-friendly interactions. This project was my first dive into:

- **Frontend Development**: Using modern frameworks and libraries to create a responsive and intuitive UI.
- **Backend Development**: Building APIs and handling server-side logic.
- **Full-Stack Integration**: Connecting the frontend and backend to create a seamless user experience.

While this app is a clone, it represents my **first steps** into the world of web development, and I'm proud of how far I've come!

## 🌟 My Journey

Building Gemini Clone was a **huge milestone** for me. As my first web app, it taught me:

- How to structure a project from scratch.
- The importance of debugging and problem-solving.
- How to integrate frontend and backend components.
- The value of version control with Git and GitHub.

It wasn’t always smooth sailing, but every challenge was an opportunity to learn and grow. I’m excited to continue improving this project and exploring new technologies in the future!
